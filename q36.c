/* 
A set of two linear equations with two unknowns x1 and x2 is given below:
ax1 + bx2 = m
cx1 + dx2 = n
The set has a unique solution:
x1 = (md - bn)/(ad - cb)
x2 = (na - mc)/(ad - cb)
provided the denominator ad - cb != 0. Write a program that will read the values of constants a,b,c,d,m and n and compute the values of x1 and x2. An appropriate message should be printed if ad - cb = 0.
